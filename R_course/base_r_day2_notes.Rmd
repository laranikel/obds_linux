## Sorting and ordering 

Can use order function to get the right order of one column and use that as an input for indexing the data frame > will 'sort' the table by that index (without the sort function; wouldnt work here) 

sort can't be used on data frames, just on vectors

1. figure out the order with order() function
2. use output of 1 as indexing to actually do the ordering of the dataframe

can order by multiple columns 

## Insert code

command + option + i to insert R code section
